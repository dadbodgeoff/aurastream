## Tips for Better Results

### Writing Effective Prompts

**Be Specific**
```
❌ "A cool thumbnail"
✅ "Energetic gaming thumbnail with neon blue lighting, 
    player celebrating victory, dark background with 
    particle effects"
```

**Include Mood**
```
❌ "Stream overlay"
✅ "Minimalist stream overlay with calm, lo-fi aesthetic, 
    soft purple gradients, clean geometric shapes"
```

**Reference Your Brand**
```
❌ "Banner for my channel"
✅ "Channel banner matching my cyberpunk theme, 
    using my brand's electric blue and hot pink, 
    futuristic city skyline"
```

### Using the Coach Effectively

1. **Start broad** — "I need a thumbnail for my Valorant stream"
2. **Answer questions** — The Coach will ask about mood, colors, composition
3. **Iterate** — "Make it more energetic" or "Add more contrast"
4. **Be specific about changes** — "Move the text to the left side"
