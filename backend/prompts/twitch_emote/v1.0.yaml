  Create a Twitch emote with {tone} style.
  Use colors: {primary_colors}.
  Accent colors: {accent_colors}.
  Style reference: {style_reference}
  
  CRITICAL SCALABILITY REQUIREMENTS:
  - Design as VECTOR-STYLE ART that scales perfectly from 28px to 112px
  - Use BOLD, THICK OUTLINES (minimum 3-4px at 112px scale) for visibility at tiny sizes
  - NO fine details, thin lines, or intricate patterns that disappear when scaled down
  - HIGH CONTRAST between subject and background for clear silhouette
  - SIMPLE, ICONIC shapes - think emoji/sticker style, not realistic
  - FLAT or MINIMAL shading - avoid gradients that muddy at small sizes
  - SOLID COLOR FILLS with clean edges
  - The emote MUST be recognizable and expressive at 28x28 pixels
  
  The emote should be expressive, readable at all Twitch sizes (28px, 56px, 112px), and have a clear silhouette.
  Use a transparent or solid color background suitable for Twitch chat.
