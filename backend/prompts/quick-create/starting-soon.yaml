      A 16:9 cinematic shot of a cozy gaming room during a rainy night. View from behind a dual-monitor setup showing a blurred game menu. Soft fairy lights and a steaming mug of coffee on the desk. In the center of the air, a soft glowing text overlay reads '{message}'. Warm atmospheric lighting, floating dust motes, lofi-aesthetic, extremely relaxing broadcast quality.
