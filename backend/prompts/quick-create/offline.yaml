  pro:
    name: "Technical Glitch"
    prompt: |
      A 16:9 'Technical Difficulties' aesthetic but professional. A dark screen with a subtle scan-line texture. A central frosted-glass UI box reads '{message}'. Below it, a clean schedule reads 'Next Stream: {schedule}'. Subtle {accent_color} RGB glitch effects on the borders, very high-end and informative.
  
  anime:
    name: "Anime Away"
    prompt: |
      A 16:9 anime-style offline screen. {character_description} sleeping or waving goodbye. Soft dreamy background with stars and {accent_color} accents. Text '{message}' in stylized anime font. 'Returning: {schedule}' in smaller text. Warm, friendly, anime aesthetic.
  
  playful:
    name: "Cozy Desk"
    prompt: |
      A 16:9 wide-shot of an empty streamer's chair and a glowing desk at midnight. The monitors show a 'Goodbye' screen with {accent_color} accents. A small sticky note on the monitor reads '{message}'. In the corner of the screen, the text 'Returning: {schedule}'. Soft moonlight coming through a window, peaceful, branded, and high-quality.
