### Product Tweets
```
Professional streaming assets in 30 seconds.

No Photoshop. No designer. No waiting.

Just describe what you want.

[Demo]
```

```
Your brand should be recognizable instantly.

Same colors. Same fonts. Same vibe.

Every thumbnail. Every emote. Every banner.

AuraStream makes it automatic.
```

```
I told AI: "Intense Valorant thumbnail, Jett clutching, neon vibes"

30 seconds later: [Result]

This is the future of creator tools.
```

### Educational Tweets
```
Thumbnail psychology 101:

Faces with emotion > No faces
High contrast > Low contrast
3 text elements max > Text overload
Action shots > Static poses

Your thumbnail has 0.5 seconds to grab attention.

Make it count.
```

```
The 3 pillars of creator branding:

1. Consistency (same colors, fonts, style)
2. Recognition (identifiable in 0.5 sec)
3. Quality (professional, not amateur)

Most creators nail 1, struggle with 2-3.

Brand Kits solve all three.
```

### Relatable Tweets
```
Stages of creator graphics:

1. MS Paint era
2. Canva template phase
3. "I'll learn Photoshop" (lies)
4. Paying designers $$$
5. AI does it in 30 seconds

We're in stage 5 now.
```

```
Things I don't miss:

- Waiting 3 days for a designer
- Paying $100 for one thumbnail
- Spending 2 hours in Photoshop
- Inconsistent branding across platforms

AI changed everything.
```

### CTA Tweets
```
3 free assets. No credit card.
